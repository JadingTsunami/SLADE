## SLADE  

A fork of slade where I keep my own personal QoL enhancement features, mostly for the Map editor:

* Y-Axis texture alignment
* Relative offsets for numerical fields in the context menu (e.g., select a bunch of items and ++/-- to increase or decrease by a given amount)
* Support mathematical expressions in numerical fields (e.g., 128-(2^4+128/4) becomes 80)
* Mouseless thing/texture browsing: Thing/Texture browser focus on filter field is automatic. Arrows work while focused on filter field. Enter applies selection.
* Keybind for changing line specials in 2D editor mode
* Keybind for creating doors
* Keybind for going to 3D mode at the current mouse location
* Keybinds for shape creation (ellipse vs. rectangle)
* Keybinds for shape features (number of sides, centered, locked ratio)
* Remember the last resource archives used when opening maps
* Option (with keybind) to move things when moving sectors
* Draw line lengths when selecting lines or moving/changing their size
